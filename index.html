<section class="introduction">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>I'm a front-end developer, specializing in inventory-management applications for the last 3 years.  That work centered around iOS devices until this year, when our small team was asked to <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/pinch-hit">'pinch-hit'</a>, shipping a mobile-ready web app on an aggressive schedule.  So I'm rediscovering web dev and remembering how engrossing CSS is!</p>
  
  <p>I'm constantly honing my skills - I'm always aiming to be to be relevant, competent, reliable, and fast!  I love helping businesses design and build systems that get the right job done.</p>

  <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
 <p>I've lived in the American Southeast most of my life, but have moved around between beach and mountains, big city and farmland.</p>

  <h2>More About Me</h2>
  <h3 class="question">What are your favorite hobbies?</h3>
  <p><em>Great food</em> is a big part of my life, and I prefer to find it in beautiful surroundings.  Failing the view, I'll settle into a gorgeous movie.  I keep "computer crone" syndrome away with yoga practice and frequent floor sitting.</p>
    <h3>What's your dream job?</h3>
  <p>My dream job allows me to use my design education and experience from my architect's practice to build beautiful digital systems with a strategic eye on the big business picture, and to keep up with state-of-the-art tech.  I get to identify needs and requirements, analyze priorities, build implementations and plan reuse....and play with CSS!</p>
    <h3>What music have you been listening to lately?</h3>
  <p>The dancer in me is a sucker for a great torch song! I enjoyed a recent <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/07/30/427711119/jason-isbell-has-conquered-fear-but-hes-still-learning-about-family">NPR interview</a> with Jason Isbell on his "Something More Than Free".  At work you'll catch jazz in my headphones; <a href="http://www.norahjones.com/">Norah Jones</a> is a favorite.</p>
